IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT (THIS “LICENSE”) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE MAGIC LEAP CREATOR RESOURCES THAT ACCOMPANY THIS LICENSE. 

Welcome, and thank you for exploring our Magic Leap creator resources and helping to bring our vision of spatial computing to life! Please note that your use of the resources that accompany this License (“creator resources”) is governed by the Magic Leap Creator Agreement, the latest version of which is available at https://id.magicleap.com/terms/developer. 

In particular, please note that pursuant to the terms of the Creator Agreement, the creator resources that accompany this License may include example or template source code, projects or content (“Example Assets”). 

The following applies to Example Assets that are not Restricted Example Assets (as defined below) (“Unrestricted Example Assets”) and may include, without limitation, certain code, libraries, scenes, scripts, and configuration files. Provided that your changes or additions to Unrestricted Example Assets are sufficiently substantial to create a derivative software applications for use on or with, and distribution through, Magic Leap’s platform (“Application”) (as determined in Magic Leap’s sole discretion), Magic Leap hereby grants you the right to use, modify, publish, and distribute those modified Unrestricted Example Assets as part of your Application. You shall comply with all laws applicable to the foregoing activities. We may provide certain Unrestricted Example Assets that are subject to a license agreement, notices, restrictions, or other terms that the licensor of certain third-party software, tools, services, features, application or content provides you. The rights in this section do not expand or modify your limited rights to any other Magic Leap or third-party content, products, assets or services that are not Unrestricted Example Assets.

The following applies only to Restricted Example Assets. Certain Example Assets may be marked as “Restricted”, “Not For Redistribution” or similar on the portal, in the file directories of a downloadable package, or in the materials accompanying such assets (“Restricted Example Assets”) and may include, without limitation, certain icons, logos, artwork, font files or similar assets. Restricted Example Assets are licensed to you under separate license terms if such terms are included in the materials accompanying the Restricted Example Assets (“Restricted Example Asset Terms”). If separate license terms are not provided with a Restricted Example Asset, then the terms of this License and the Creator Agreement with respect to Portal Content (as defined in the Creator Agreement) will apply (including the scope of license and the restrictions described therein). In the event of a conflict between the terms of the Creator Agreement and the Restricted Example Asset Terms, the Restricted Example Asset Terms will govern.  No other use of the Restricted Example Assets is licensed or permitted, and you may not otherwise use, modify, adapt, alter, reproduce, distribute, sublicense, or transfer Restricted Example Assets.
